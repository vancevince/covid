# covid
A simple repository to familiarize myself with pandas. COVID data at one time was released daily and offered a big
data set to manipulate.

At first I just learned how to capture the data, but then I moved on to rendering it in a plot. The next step was
to render a heat map showing the parts of South Carolina where COVID cases were clustered. I ran into some issues
importing the correct modules and left off there.
